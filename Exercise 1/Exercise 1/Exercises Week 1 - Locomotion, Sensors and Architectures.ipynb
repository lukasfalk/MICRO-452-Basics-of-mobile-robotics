This clears all variables stored in memory and runs the notebook from scratch. It is important to re-run the notebook from scratch from time to time, for example when you have reached a milestone to make sure that you don't have any bugs. As the notebook stores all the variables in memory, this helps avoid errors due to having deleted something, or have certain elements in the incorrect order within the cells or between cells. \n",
